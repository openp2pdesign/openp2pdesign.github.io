In this way, Open \u0026 Distributed Making and Design initiatives create collaborative collective actions: distributed among several actors, several approaches, several locations and laboratories. The Maker Movement is often based on community-based initiatives that can be found on three levels: 1) a global community local events like Maker Faires and laboratories like Fab Labs with a complex social structure; 2) local communities that form in and around local laboratories such as Fab Labs; 3) the communities that form around the development of projects, especially the ones that are shared with open source digital tools openly as Open Design. Furthermore, the ability of this phenomenon of bridging the local and digital dimensions constitute a reason for identifying such movement as a clear example of digital social innovation: people, projects and organizations that use digital technology to tackle social and environmental challenges with a leading focus on social or environmental impact over financial return and a dedication to openness, collaboration and citizen empowerment. What is the social impact of Maker initiatives? How can we assess their value in terms of collaborative action and social innovation? Understanding their impact would help them in their awareness, communication and management towards sharing societies. We evaluated an existing dataset of 69 Social Impact Assessment (SIA) frameworks in order to understand how they can be applied and to which kind of initiatives. After this evaluation, we elaborated directions for future work towards compiling such framework into a composite index that the common elements of such frameworks in order to provide a simplified and standardized measurement tool with guidelines for its development into a digital platform accessible to Maker initiatives, for self-assessment. Furthermore, we propose directions for future research, especially for the evaluation of such index and platform with an action research approach and the involvement of all types of stakeholders: civic society, research, business and policymaking. This approach would enable Maker initiatives (but also researchers, businesses and policymakers) to understand what they could have in societal change and economy and therefore improve the way they are organized, develop projects, do research, interact with stakeholders and demonstrate their value. This would, ultimately, help Maker initiatives in better define who they are as both individual makers and as communities of makers and labs.","tags":null,"title":"Measuring the Social Impact of Maker Initiatives.

To explore expectations and values within the Maker movement, we applied qualitative research method, interviewing 10 managers of maker initiative as well as 39 makers from eight different countries. The paper analyses how the Maker movement is contributing to a change in production, logistics and supply chains and how it changes the relationship between producer and consumer. Based on the interview data and supported by literature, the study indicates that the Maker movement has the potential to impact producer-consumer relationships in many ways. Making, on a bigger scale would mean producing locally, de-centralised and on-demand. This would have an impact on the logistics and the supply chain. Long transportation routes would be avoided and shorter supply chains would make some of the-in-between vendors obsolete.

Classifying concepts, i.e. building taxonomies, is a fundamental practice when developing a topic of interest into a research field. Taking advantage of the growth of the Social Web and participation platforms, this paper suggests a multidisciplinary analysis of communications and online behaviors related to the Maker community in order to develop a taxonomy informed by current practices and ongoing discussions. We analyze a number of sources such as Twitter, Wikipedia and Google Trends, applying co-word analysis, trend visualizations and emotional analysis. Whereas co-words and trends extract structural characteristics of the movement, emotional analysis is non-topical, extracting emotional interpretations.","tags":["Artificial Intelligence (incl.

It provides an overview of recent research specifically focused on the user’s democratic participation and empowerment. It also enables readers to better identify the main opportunities of participatory design, a concept which encourages the blurring of the role between user and designer. This allows people to escape their status as “end-user” and to elevate themselves to the level of creator.This book explores new avenues for rethinking the processes and practices of corporate innovation in order to cope with current socio-economic and technological changes. In so doing, it aims to help companies renew industrial models that allow them to design and produce new ranges of technological products and services by giving the user an active role in the development process, far beyond the basic role of consumer.Intended for designers, design researchers and scientists interested in innovation and technology management, this book also provides a valuable resource for professionals involved in technology-based innovation processes.","tags":null,"title":"Open Meta-Design: Tools for Designing Collaborative Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Massimo Menichinelli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"b043451574cde889c3e1467f8a947804","permalink":"https://openp2pdesign.github.io/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-come-2015/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T17:58:01.091828Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-come-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Come costruire un FabLab?

This time is about the policies for Digital Fabrication. And manufacturing left the country Most of the policies regarding digital fabrication addresses (and try to revert) the phenomena of manufacturing industries leaving countries like USA or UK and moving to China. Let’s then start our research with an overview of the phenomena. The Insourcing Boom article by By Charles Fishman gives a great overview of the phenomena, telling the story of General Electric: In 1951, when General Electric designed the industrial park, the company’s ambition was as big as the place itself; GE didn’t build an appliance factory so much as an appliance city. Five of the six factory buildings were part of the original plan, and early on Appliance Park had a dedicated power plant, its own fire department, and the first computer ever used in a factory. The facility was so large that it got its own ZIP code (40225). It was the headquarters for GE’s appliance division, as well as the place where just about all of the appliances were made. [...] Employment kept rising through the ’60s, but it peaked at 23,000 in 1973, 20 years after the facility first opened.

Since I am a designer, I have to admit that I have very little experience of drafting public policies. However, in the past year I’ve been personally involved in the process of drafting recommendations for the Design policies for the European Union. Furthermore, my curiosity towards public policies also increased with many new examples of interesting policies regarding digital fabrication and FabLabs. It is therefore very important to start tracking the discussion about these new public policies, since they will affect us in the near future, and Open Design and digital fabrication will be a part of them for sure. All the pictures of this post are copyright of Anna Berg @ Aalto Media Factory – here is the Flickr account.  Co-design of the new design policies The European Design Leadership Board for the European Design Innovation Initiative (EDII) was established in early 2011 by Commission Vice President Antonio Tajani, responsible for Enterprise and Industry. It comprises fifteen members drawn from a wide-ranging and representative cross-section of design, industry and academia as well as regional and national agencies promoting design and innovation. It is supported by a Secretariat based in Aalto University, Helsinki (the same University where I am lecturing, working and studying).

As said before, there is no single book or how-to guide for starting a FabLab, for two reasons: on one side the knowledge required for starting and running a FabLab is always under development and evolution, on the other side the unique conditions of the local context require each time to develop a custom model. Check other suggestions about starting a FabLab here. 01. Start from the local conditions Always start from understanding and defining the local conditions and how they will influence your project. The only business model that works in Finland won’t likely work in Italy; the laws that regulate access, education and safety in the use of the machines are different in each country; the understanding and the popularity of what a FabLab is (and therefore the amount and quantity communication required for promoting it) will be different in each country; the legal organizational forms and the wage formats and levels will vary in each country; the locally available materials and components will be different; the format of the FabLab will be influenced by the …","tags":null,"title":"10 things to do when starting a FabLab","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Massimo Menichinelli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"6ac66964b5205678ee18c36020f28eaf","permalink":"https://openp2pdesign.github.io/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-first-2013/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T17:58:01.07889Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-first-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Almost five years have passed since I first blogged about the first mass product that was an Open Design initiative.

All the pictures come from the Aalto FabLab’s Flickr account, where automatically pictures are uploaded, showing thus all the activities and the projects developed in the lab. What is a FabLab, then? 01. A space about bits and atoms Though it may be also a space for developing prototypes or building final working products, the main goal for a FabLab is to be a space for experimenting at the intersection of bits and atoms, information and matter. It is not by accident that the concept has been developed at MIT at the Center for Bits and Atoms, not at the High-Low Tech research group. That’s why there is a huge adoption of tools and components for working with electronics, for example. Basically, a FabLab gives you a space, tools, processes and knowledge for developing physical representations of digital data, and exporting digital data …","tags":null,"title":"What is a FabLab?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Massimo Menichinelli"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1359676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1359676800,"objectID":"5042fa0090f61bd2da142c04bb1b4d99","permalink":"https://openp2pdesign.github.io/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-what-2013/","publishdate":"2019-12-15T17:58:01.096215Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/publication/menichinelli-what-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"This is a post I’ve been waiting to write for a long time, either because I’ve been very busy or because I’ve wanted to write something meaningful and with a direct experience.

Sebbene gruppi di persone erano giá presenti, solo nel 2011 si é formalizzata una discussione online su Facebook, dapprima incentrata solo su Milano, e poi aperta a tutto il territorio nazionale sotto il nome del gruppo Fabber in Italia. Visto che recentemente si sta discutendo sul se e come portare la discussione e la comunitá al di fuori di Facebook per svariati motivi, ho deciso di rianalizzare le reti sociali della comunitá e le interazioni che avvengono fra i membri. In questo modo possiamo capire cosa realmente stia succedendo nella comunitá, quali siano le persone chiave e le direzioni, e cosa possa succedere poi una volta passati ad un’altra piattaforma. Per esportare i dati da Facebook ho utilizzato l’applicazione Netvizz, per poi analizzare le reti estratte con Gephi, un eccezionale strumento open source per l’analisi di reti sociali. Ho iniziato anche a studiare come si possa sviluppare una applicazione per estrarre ancora piú dati da Facebook, ma ci vorrá del tempo prima che sia stabile. Le analisi sono state effettuate il giorno 09 Gennaio 2013 La rete sociale delle amicizie La rete sociale delle amicizie fra i membri del gruppo ammonta a 791 nodi (ovvero membri della comunitá) e 3655 connessioni (relazioni di amicizie tra i membri).
