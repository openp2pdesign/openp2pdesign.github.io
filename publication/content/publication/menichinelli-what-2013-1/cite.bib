After working on the development of the Aalto FabLab, after doing the one week Fab Boot Camp (January 2012) in FabLab Barcelona and the 5 months FabAcademy in FabLab Amsterdam (and after years of previous research on the topic), after visiting other FabLabs and meeting people in the community, I now have enough experience and material to write this post.
All the pictures come from the Aalto FabLab’s Flickr account, where automatically pictures are uploaded, showing thus all the activities and the projects developed in the lab.
What is a FabLab, then?
01. A space about bits and atoms
Though it may be also a space for developing prototypes or building final working products, the main goal for a FabLab is to be a space for experimenting at the intersection of bits and atoms, information and matter. It is not by accident that the concept has been developed at MIT at the Center for Bits and Atoms, not at the High-Low Tech research group.
That’s why there is a huge adoption of tools and components for working with electronics, for example. Basically, a FabLab gives you a space, tools, processes and knowledge for developing physical representations of digital data, and exporting digital data …},
