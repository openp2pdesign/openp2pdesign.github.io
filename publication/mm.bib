	abstract = {The democratization of technology, education, content and community building brought by Fab Labs and other Maker laboratories increases the possibilities for designers to acquire more technological and practical skills, for makers to evolve their design attitude and capabilities, and for amateurs to acquire both technological and design skills. In this way, Open \& Distributed Making and Design initiatives create collaborative collective actions: distributed among several actors, several approaches, several locations and laboratories. The Maker Movement is often based on community-based initiatives that can be found on three levels: 1) a global community local events like Maker Faires and laboratories like Fab Labs with a complex social structure; 2) local communities that form in and around local laboratories such as Fab Labs; 3) the communities that form around the development of projects, especially the ones that are shared with open source digital tools openly as Open Design.
Furthermore, the ability of this phenomenon of bridging the local and digital dimensions constitute a reason for identifying such movement as a clear example of digital social innovation: people, projects and organizations that use digital technology to tackle social
and environmental challenges with a leading focus on social or environmental impact over financial return and a dedication to openness, collaboration and citizen empowerment.
What is the social impact of Maker initiatives? How can we assess their value in terms of collaborative action and social innovation?
Understanding their impact would help them in their awareness, communication and management towards sharing societies. We evaluated an existing dataset of 69 Social Impact Assessment (SIA) frameworks in order to understand how they can be applied and to which kind of initiatives. After this evaluation, we elaborated directions for future work
towards compiling such framework into a composite index that the common elements of such frameworks in order to provide a simplified and standardized measurement tool with guidelines for its development into a digital platform accessible to Maker initiatives, for self-assessment.
Furthermore, we propose directions for future research, especially for the evaluation of such index and platform with an action research approach and the involvement of all types of stakeholders: civic society, research, business and policymaking. This approach would enable Maker initiatives (but also researchers, businesses and policymakers) to understand what they could have in societal change and economy and therefore improve the way they are organized, develop projects, do research, interact with stakeholders and
demonstrate their value. This would, ultimately, help Maker initiatives in better define who they are as both individual makers and as communities of makers and labs.},

Classifying concepts, i.e. building taxonomies, is a fundamental practice when developing a topic of interest into a research field. Taking advantage of the growth of the Social Web and participation platforms, this paper suggests a multidisciplinary analysis of communications and online behaviors related to the Maker community in order to develop a taxonomy informed by current practices and ongoing discussions. We analyze a number of sources such as Twitter, Wikipedia and Google Trends, applying co-word analysis, trend visualizations and emotional analysis. Whereas co-words and trends extract structural characteristics of the movement, emotional analysis is non-topical, extracting emotional interpretations.},

	abstract = {With this post I start a series of blog posts regarding the relationships between Open Design, digital fabrication and FabLabs with public policies. Since I am a designer, I have to admit that I have very little experience of drafting public policies. However, in the past year I’ve been personally involved in the process of drafting recommendations for the Design policies for the European Union. Furthermore, my curiosity towards public policies also increased with many new examples of interesting policies regarding digital fabrication and FabLabs. It is therefore very important to start tracking the discussion about these new public policies, since they will affect us in the near future, and Open Design and digital fabrication will be a part of them for sure.

Co-design of the new design policies
The European Design Leadership Board for the European Design Innovation Initiative (EDII) was established in early 2011 by Commission Vice President Antonio Tajani, responsible for Enterprise and Industry. It comprises fifteen members drawn from a wide-ranging and representative cross-section of design, industry and academia as well as regional and national agencies promoting design and innovation. It is supported by a Secretariat based in Aalto University, Helsinki (the same University where I am lecturing, working and studying).
Vice President Tajani invited the Leadership Board to provide recommendations on how …},

And manufacturing left the country
Most of the policies regarding digital fabrication addresses (and try to revert) the phenomena of manufacturing industries leaving countries like USA or UK and moving to China. Let’s then start our research with an overview of the phenomena. The Insourcing Boom article by By Charles Fishman gives a great overview of the phenomena, telling the story of General Electric:
In 1951, when General Electric designed the industrial park, the company’s ambition was as big as the place itself; GE didn’t build an appliance factory so much as an appliance city. Five of the six factory buildings were part of the original plan, and early on Appliance Park had a dedicated power plant, its own fire department, and the first computer ever used in a factory. The facility was so large that it got its own ZIP code (40225). It was the headquarters for GE’s appliance division, as well as the place where just about all of the appliances were made.
[...]
Employment kept rising through the ’60s, but it peaked at 23,000 in 1973, 20 years after the facility first opened.

Even as recently as 2000, a typical Chinese factory worker …},

	abstract = {Giá tempo fa avevo analizzato, seppur brevemente, la comunitá che si sta formando, in Italia, di persone interessate al mondo Maker e del Fabbing. Sebbene gruppi di persone erano giá presenti, solo nel 2011 si é formalizzata una discussione online su Facebook, dapprima incentrata solo su Milano, e poi aperta a tutto il territorio nazionale sotto il nome del gruppo Fabber in Italia.
Visto che recentemente si sta discutendo sul se e come portare la discussione e la comunitá al di fuori di Facebook per svariati motivi, ho deciso di rianalizzare le reti sociali della comunitá e le interazioni che avvengono fra i membri. In questo modo possiamo capire cosa realmente stia succedendo nella comunitá, quali siano le persone chiave e le direzioni, e cosa possa succedere poi una volta passati ad un’altra piattaforma.
Per esportare i dati da Facebook ho utilizzato l’applicazione Netvizz, per poi analizzare le reti estratte con Gephi, un eccezionale strumento open source per l’analisi di reti sociali. Ho iniziato anche a studiare come si possa sviluppare una applicazione per estrarre ancora piú dati da Facebook, ma ci vorrá del tempo prima che sia stabile.
Le analisi sono state effettuate il giorno 09 Gennaio 2013
La rete sociale delle amicizie
La rete sociale delle amicizie fra i membri del gruppo ammonta a 791 nodi (ovvero membri della comunitá) e 3655 connessioni (relazioni di amicizie tra i membri).

	abstract = {This is a post I’ve been waiting to write for a long time, either because I’ve been very busy or because I’ve wanted to write something meaningful and with a direct experience. After working on the development of the Aalto FabLab, after doing the one week Fab Boot Camp (January 2012) in FabLab Barcelona and the 5 months FabAcademy in FabLab Amsterdam (and after years of previous research on the topic), after visiting other FabLabs and meeting people in the community, I now have enough experience and material to write this post.
All the pictures come from the Aalto FabLab’s Flickr account, where automatically pictures are uploaded, showing thus all the activities and the projects developed in the lab.
What is a FabLab, then?
01. A space about bits and atoms
Though it may be also a space for developing prototypes or building final working products, the main goal for a FabLab is to be a space for experimenting at the intersection of bits and atoms, information and matter. It is not by accident that the concept has been developed at MIT at the Center for Bits and Atoms, not at the High-Low Tech research group.
That’s why there is a huge adoption of tools and components for working with electronics, for example. Basically, a FabLab gives you a space, tools, processes and knowledge for developing physical representations of digital data, and exporting digital data …},

As said before, there is no single book or how-to guide for starting a FabLab, for two reasons: on one side the knowledge required for starting and running a FabLab is always under development and evolution, on the other side the unique conditions of the local context require each time to develop a custom model. Check other suggestions about starting a FabLab here.
01. Start from the local conditions
Always start from understanding and defining the local conditions and how they will influence your project. The only business model that works in Finland won’t likely work in Italy; the laws that regulate access, education and safety in the use of the machines are different in each country; the understanding and the popularity of what a FabLab is (and therefore the amount and quantity communication required for promoting it) will be different in each country; the legal organizational forms and the wage formats and levels will vary in each country; the locally available materials and components will be different; the format of the FabLab will be influenced by the …},

To explore expectations and values within the Maker movement, we applied qualitative research method, interviewing 10 managers of maker initiative as well as 39 makers from eight different countries. The paper analyses how the Maker movement is contributing to a change in production, logistics and supply chains and how it changes the relationship between producer and consumer. Based on the interview data and supported by literature, the study indicates that the Maker movement has the potential to impact producer-consumer relationships in many ways. Making, on a bigger scale would mean producing locally, de-centralised and on-demand. This would have an impact on the logistics and the supply chain. Long transportation routes would be avoided and shorter supply chains would make some of the-in-between vendors obsolete. Makers as prosumers, who produce for themselves, are introducing two growing phenomena: a more personalised relationship between maker and object and personalised products as a form of self-expression.},

	abstract = {At the crossroads of various disciplines, this collective work examines the possibility of a new end-user “engagement” in ongoing digital/technological products and services development. It provides an overview of recent research specifically focused on the user’s democratic participation and empowerment. It also enables readers to better identify the main opportunities of participatory design, a concept which encourages the blurring of the role between user and designer. This allows people to escape their status as “end-user” and to elevate themselves to the level of creator.This book explores new avenues for rethinking the processes and practices of corporate innovation in order to cope with current socio-economic and technological changes. In so doing, it aims to help companies renew industrial models that allow them to design and produce new ranges of technological products and services by giving the user an active role in the development process, far beyond the basic role of consumer.Intended for designers, design researchers and scientists interested in innovation and technology management, this book also provides a valuable resource for professionals involved in technology-based innovation processes.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how the approach, logic and tools of Service Design could support the development of a digital platform that enable the collaborative design of open and collaborative design processes. By integrating Service Design, Activity Theory and Meta-Design, such platform could foster community building and management providing concepts and visualizations that help users in the conscious and reflexive design of the activities constituting their community-based collaborative design processes. How could Service Design enable the meta-design of collaborative design processes on digital platforms? This paper elaborates a proposal for integrating Service Design concepts and tools into a meta-design digital platform for the design and management of collaborative design processes, by providing 1) a reflection on the theoretical connections between Service Design, Activity Theory and Meta-Design, 2) a proposal of a meta-design platform that represents a proof of concept of such connections and 3) a proposal of evaluation strategies for validating such platform.},

	abstract = {What is the resilience of a city regarding its manufacturing, distribution and consumption of goods? What is the role of citizens in changing the existing networks with open, distributed and collaborative projects and making activities in the city? The Fab City Dashboard project aims at developing a visualisation tool for Fab Cities that show the relation between urban spaces and their networks of design, production and consumption by highlighting their supply chains, resilience and impact. Such a tool can help cities and citizens to understand how citizens design and produce in urban spaces within networks of suppliers, manufacturers, craftsmen, fab labs, makerspaces, hackerspaces, and so on.{\textless}br{\textgreater}

The Fab City Dashboard project was selected for the Visualizar’16 International Workshop, titled Ciudades abiertas, Open Cities - September 26th to October 5th. During ten days, eight multidisciplinary teams developed eight projects dealing with city data. The selected projects were presented during the Open Cities Summit, the international summit of open cities, which took place in Medialab-Prado on October 5th within the framework of the activities previous to the International Open Data Conference, \#IODC16.

Within this context, how can be collaborative design processes documented, analysed, managed, shared? This article investigates the role of meta-design digital tools for the facilitation of distributed systems of creative agents, formally trained and informal amateurs that collaboratively design and produce artefacts. It documents a research study organised for testing a digital meta-design platform with users and the researcher as meta-designer: the results provide insights for improving the platform but also for building a comprehensive research through design framework that connects meta-design research and practice for exploring the role and nature of meta-design and meta-designers in facilitating collaborative design processes starting from their description with digital ontologies.},
