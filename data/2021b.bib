	abstract = {As Open Design is an emergent phenomenon, both practitioners and researchers have tried to both develop it and take a picture of it. Beyond the only apparent simplicity of Open Design as an “openly accessible design documentation”, it has been lacking a clear definition that instead Open Source Software and Hardware have established quickly in their path. This paper contributes to this gap with a literature review and the analysis of a case study of a community-based initiative for defining Open Design through an open online discussion. As a result, insights about how to define Open Design and its common elements and how to consider the collaborative process in the task are outlined.},
