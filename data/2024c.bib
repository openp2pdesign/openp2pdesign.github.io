	abstract = {Re-organizing cities with proximity-based urban planning models such as the 15-Minute City model is an emerging and promising direction of policy, practice and research for sustainable cities. The planning of new urban spaces, infrastructures and mobilities requires planning and designing services that support citizens in their proximities. Along this direction, the emergence of the Maker Movement and its maker laboratories (Fab Labs, Makerspaces, Hackerspaces, DIYbio Labs, and so on) contributes to building the infrastructure for distributed design and manufacturing services in cities. How can we adopt the impact assessment of maker services in terms of potential accessibility for designing services towards the 15-Minute City model? We explore this issue within the context of the metropolitan areas of Barcelona and Milan by analysing 1) the 15-minute walking distance catchment areas of their maker service; 2) how to adopt this method for service design and impact assessment in the 15-Minute City model.},
